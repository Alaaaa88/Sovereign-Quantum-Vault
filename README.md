# 🇸🇦 Sovereign-Quantum-Vault (SQS)

**High-Performance Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Core optimized for Saudi National Infrastructure.**

## 🌟 Overview
Sovereign-Quantum-Vault is a hardware-accelerated cryptographic engine designed to bridge the gap between **Military-Grade Security** and **Ultra-Low Latency**. Built with C++20, it leverages AVX-512 and SIMD vectorization to eliminate the "Quantum Bottleneck."

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks
* **Target Latency:** < 0.631 µs.
* **Throughput Optimization:** 70% reduction in CPU cycles.
* **Instruction Set:** Optimized for AVX-512 & AVX2.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
The core focuses on accelerating polynomial multiplication—the most computationally expensive part of Lattice-based cryptography (e.g., Kyber). By processing 16-bit coefficients in parallel, we achieve native execution speeds.

## 🇸🇦 Vision 2030 Alignment
Digital sovereignty requires locally-engineered tools. SQS provides a 100% Saudi-developed codebase to secure national data against future quantum threats without sacrificing system performance.
